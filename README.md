# Awesome-Application-Security-Checklist
  If you are designing, creating, testing  your web/mobile application with security in mind, this Checklist of counter-measures can be a good starting point 




##### AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS (Signup/Signin/2 Factor/Password reset) 
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere.
- [ ] Store password hashes using `Bcrypt` (no salt necessary - `Bcrypt` does it for you).
- [ ] Destroy the session identifier after `logout`.  
- [ ] Destroy all active sessions on reset password (or offer to).  
- [ ] Must have the `state` parameter in OAuth2.
- [ ] No open redirects after successful login or in any other intermediate redirects.
- [ ] When parsing Signup/Login input, sanitize for javascript://, data://, CRLF characters. 
- [ ] Set secure, httpOnly cookies.
- [ ] In Mobile `OTP` based mobile verification, do not send the OTP back in the response when `generate OTP` or `Resend OTP`  API is called.
- [ ] Limit attempts to `Login`, `Verify OTP`, `Resend OTP` and `generate OTP` APIs for a particular user. Have an exponential backoff set or/and something like a captcha based challenge.
- [ ] Check for randomness of reset password token in the emailed link or SMS.
- [ ] Set an expiration on the reset password token for a reasonable period.
- [ ] Expire the reset token after it has been successfully used.



##### USER DATA & AUTHORIZATION
- [ ] Any resource access like, `my cart`, `my history` should check the logged in user's ownership of the resource using session id.
- [ ] Serially iterable resource id should be avoided. Use `/me/orders` instead of `/user/37153/orders`. This acts as a sanity check in case you forgot to check for authorization token. 
- [ ] `Edit email/phone number` feature should be accompanied by a verification email to the owner of the account. 
- [ ] Any upload feature should sanitize the filename provided by the user. Also, for generally reasons apart from security, upload to something like S3 (and post-process using lambda) and not your own server capable of executing code.  
- [ ] `Profile photo upload` feature should sanitize all the `EXIF` tags also if not required.
- [ ] For user ids and other ids, use [RFC compliant ](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) `UUID` instead of integers. You can find an implementation for this for your language on Github.
- [ ] JWT are awesome. Use them if required for your single page app/APIs.

##### Database
- [ ]  Use encryption for data identifying users and sensitive data like access tokens, email addresses or billing details.
- [ ]  If your database supports low cost encryption at rest (like AWS Aurora), then enable that to secure data on disk. Make sure all backups are stored encrypted as well.
- [ ]  Use minimal privilege for the database access user account. Don’t use the database root account.
 - [ ] Store and distribute secrets using a key store designed for the purpose. Don’t hard code in your applications.
 - [ ] Fully prevent SQL injection by only using SQL prepared statements. For example: if using NPM, don’t use npm-mysql, use npm-mysql2 which supports prepared statements.

##### ANDROID / IOS APP
- [ ] `salt` from payment gateways should not be hardcoded.
- [ ] `secret` / `auth token` from 3rd party SDK's should not be hardcoded.
- [ ] API calls intended to be done `server to server` should not be done from the app.
- [ ] In Android, all the granted  [permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html) should be carefully evaluated.
- [ ] On iOS, store sensitive information (authentication tokens, API keys, etc.) in the system keychain. Do __not__ store this kind of information in the user defaults.
- [ ] [Certificate pinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning) is highly recommended.



##### SECURITY HEADERS & CONFIGURATIONS
- [ ] `Add` [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) header to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks. This is important.
- [ ] `Add` [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) header to prevent cross site request forgery. Also add [SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-same-site-00) attributes on cookies.
- [ ] `Add` [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) header to prevent SSL stripping attack.
- [ ] `Add` your domain to the [HSTS Preload List](https://hstspreload.org/)
- [ ] `Add` [X-Frame-Options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking#X-Frame-Options) to protect against Clickjacking.
- [ ] `Add` [X-XSS-Protection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project#X-XSS-Protection) header to mitigate XSS attacks.
- [ ] Update DNS records to add [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) record to mitigate spam and phishing attacks.
- [ ] Add [subresource integrity checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subresource_Integrity) if loading your JavaScript libraries from a third party CDN. For extra security, add the [require-sri-for](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/#parse-require-sri-for) CSP-directive so you don't load resources that don't have an SRI sat.  
- [ ] Use random CSRF tokens and expose business logic APIs as HTTP POST requests. Do not expose CSRF tokens over HTTP for example in an initial request upgrade phase.
- [ ] Do not use critical data or tokens in GET request parameters. Exposure of server logs or a machine/stack processing them would expose user data in turn.  

  
##### SANITIZATION OF INPUT
- [ ] `Sanitize` all user inputs or any input parameters exposed to user to prevent [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).
- [ ] Always use parameterized queries to prevent [SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).  
- [ ] Sanitize user input if using it directly for functionalities like CSV import.
- [ ] `Sanitize` user input for special cases like robots.txt as profile names in case you are using a url pattern like coolcorp.io/username. 
- [ ] Do not hand code or build JSON by string concatenation ever, no matter how small the object is. Use your language defined libraries or framework.
- [ ] Sanitize inputs that take some sort of URLs to prevent [SSRF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1TkWZtrhzRLy0bYXBcdLUedXGb9njTNIJXa3u9akHM/edit#heading=h.t4tsk5ixehdd).
- [ ] Sanitize Outputs before displaying to users.

##### Denial of Service Protection
- [ ] Make sure that DOS attacks on your APIs won’t cripple your site. At a minimum, have rate limiters on your slower API paths like login and token generation routines. Consider CAPTCHA on front-end APIs to protect back-end services against DOS.
- [ ] Enforce sanity limits on the size and structure of user submitted data and requests.
- [ ] Use Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) mitigation via a global caching proxy service like CloudFlare. This can be turned on if you suffer a DDOS attack and otherwise function as your DNS lookup.

##### OPERATIONS
- [ ] If you are small and inexperienced, evaluate using AWS elasticbeanstalk or a PaaS to run your code.
- [ ] Use a decent provisioning script to create VMs in the cloud.
- [ ] Check for machines with unwanted publicly `open ports`.
- [ ] Check for no/default passwords for `databases` especially MongoDB & Redis.
- [ ] Use SSH to access your machines; do not setup a password, use SSH key-based authentication instead.
- [ ] Install updates timely to act upon zero day vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, Shellshock.
- [ ] Modify server config to use TLS 1.2 for HTTPS and disable all other schemes. (The tradeoff is good.)
- [ ] Do not leave the DEBUG mode on. In some frameworks, DEBUG mode can give access full-fledged REPL or shells or expose critical data in error messages stacktraces.
- [ ] Be prepared for bad actors & DDOS - use a hosting service that has DDOS mitigation.
- [ ] Set up monitoring for your systems, and log stuff (use [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) or something like that).
- [ ] If developing for enterprise customers, adhere to compliance requirements. If AWS S3, consider using the feature to [encrypt data](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html). If using AWS EC2, consider using the feature to use encrypted volumes (even boot volumes can be encrypted now).



CI & CD
 Audit your design and implementation with unit/integration tests coverage.
 Use a code review process and disregard self-approval.
 Ensure that all components of your services are statically scanned by AV software before pushing to production, including vendor libraries and other dependencies.
 Design a rollback solution for deployments.



##### PEOPLE
- [ ] Set up an email (e.g. security@coolcorp.io) and a page for security researchers to report vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Depending on what you are making, limit access to your user databases.
- [ ] Be polite to bug reporters.
- [ ] Have your code review done by a fellow developer from a secure coding perspective. (More eyes)
- [ ] In case of a hack or data breach, check previous logs for data access, ask people to change passwords. You might require an audit by external agencies depending on where you are incorporated.  
- [ ] Set up [Netflix's Scumblr](https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr) to hear about talks about your organization on social platforms and Google search.
